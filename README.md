EasyCrops Overview

EasyCrops is a simple way of knowing if the crops are fully grown. Once the crop has fully grown, the top will turn black allowing you to tell the difference.

(This README.md looks terrible. Leave me alone <3)

Yes, its very basic but it is very useful for lots of people growing things!

Crops Supported:
Wheat
Potatoes
Carrots
Beetroots

Resource Pack updates may only include new crops (if added) and other items. (Not Often) but will always be kept up to date with minecraft versions above 1.17
